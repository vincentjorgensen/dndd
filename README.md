Table Top Role-Playing Game Dice Roller

## Usage
dndd 2d20 2  
or  
dndd 2 2d20  

The order of arguments doesn't matter. All numbers that do not contain a "d"
will be added to the total as modifiers

2d20 means roll a 20-sided die twice and add their totals together

## TODO
Add "advantage" and "disadvantage". Maybe "ad20" and "dad20" ?
